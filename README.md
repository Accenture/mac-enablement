# Mac Enablement at Accenture

This repository is a collection of various scripts and tools created by the Mac Workstation Team at Accenture. They are grouped into sub-folders according to general usage.

## Getting Started

Be sure to read the notes about each script. If there is an interdependency it should be noted.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a Mac, of course. :) 

Ruby scripts will require the appropriate gems to be installed. 
We leverage [ruby-jss](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/ruby-jss) for several tools.
```
gem install ruby-jss
```
should get you going.
