# Mac Enablement at Accenture

This repository is a collection of various scripts and tools created by the Mac Workstation Team at Accenture.

It should be thought of as a toolbox, rather than a complete project. You might need only one or two of the things listed here,
and that's fine.

## Getting Started

Be sure to read the notes below about each script. If there is an interdependency it should be noted within each script's description.


### Prerequisites

You'll need a Mac, of course. :) 

Ruby scripts will require the appropriate gems to be installed. 
We leverage ruby-jss for several tools: https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/ruby-jss
```
gem install ruby-jss
```
should get you going.
